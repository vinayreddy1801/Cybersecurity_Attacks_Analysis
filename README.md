# Cybersecurity Attacks Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of over 40,000 cybersecurity incidents from 2020 to 2023. The primary goal is to uncover patterns, identify vulnerabilities, and derive actionable insights to strengthen cybersecurity strategies.

## Features
- Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify attack trends, severity, and geographical distribution.
- Visualizations created using **Python** and **Tableau** to illustrate patterns in attack types and severity levels.
- Actionable recommendations for improving resource allocation and mitigation strategies.

---

## Dataset Overview
The dataset (`cybersecurity_attacks.csv`) includes:
- **Attack Type**: Type of incident (e.g., phishing, DDoS, ransomware).
- **Severity**: Severity level of each attack.
- **Region**: Geographic region where the attack occurred.
- **Year**: The year the incident was recorded.
- **Additional Details**: Other metadata related to the attacks.

> Note: The dataset has been pre-processed for the purpose of this analysis.
